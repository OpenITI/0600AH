90#VERS#COMMENT##: The version I used for collation is a reprint of the
    digital version. 2- All the tags for names (and their respective
    numbers) are inserted manually. To present the most accurate
    categorization for the text, it would be better to add the names of the
    people under discussion in front of these tags. 3- PageV01P466 and a few
    lines in PageV01P329 are missing.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
