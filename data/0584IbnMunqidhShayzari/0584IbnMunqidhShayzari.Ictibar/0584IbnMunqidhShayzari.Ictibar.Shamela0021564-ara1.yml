90#VERS#COMMENT##: Could not find the exact edition used here so I collated with the one  circulating online. It appears that the manuscript has no headers at all, so the ones in this digital text and the ones in the pdf often do not agree and generally don't look like classical Arabic headers. They must be editorial additions, so I have put all of them between square brackets. The text otherwise appears to be of good quality. I have marked only one second level header. I have tagged poetry.
