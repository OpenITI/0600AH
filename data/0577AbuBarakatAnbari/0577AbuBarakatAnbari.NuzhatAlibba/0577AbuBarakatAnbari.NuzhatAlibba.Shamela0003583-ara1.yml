90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: the name of the annotator (latin characters; please
    use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
    See, `README.md`.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A blank header added to signify the beginning of names. 2. The annotator reports “significant difference” between the digital text and the PDF in recording the tagged names. As far as I can see, in most cases, the typist has just used a shortened form for names, and this does not make a problem. However, there might be spelling errors as the annotator says (see readme file). 3. Other editions are accessible: https://archive.org/details/nozha.al.alibba.t1959; https://archive.org/details/5460pdf.
