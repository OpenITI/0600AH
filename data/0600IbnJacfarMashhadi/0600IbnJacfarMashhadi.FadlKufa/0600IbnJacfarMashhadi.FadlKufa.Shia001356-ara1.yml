90#VERS#COMMENT##: Some parts of the editor’s explanations are interred
    to the text. I tagged them as editorial. 2- A redundant tag like
    “NoteV00P043N37” is entered into the text which must be deleted.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
