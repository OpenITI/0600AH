    Gowaart: tagged poetry.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I tagged the text again. A lot of headers were
    not tagged and the levelling was totally incorrect. 2- I added a lot of
    subsections for biographical tags as #~:section:. 3- A lot of the titles were
    duplicated. I -deleted the redundant one. 4- PageV01P426-7 is missing. 5- Other
    editions of the text are accessible:
